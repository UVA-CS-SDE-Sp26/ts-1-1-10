public class CipherTest {

/*
What should I test?
    - When there is no argument (should list the numbered files available to display)
    - When it runs with a number as an argument (should display the contents of the file of that number)
    - When it runs with a number that does not have a file to match (should provide an error)
    - When it runs without a second parameter (should use the default key to decipher)
    - When it runs with a second parameter (should supply an alternate key to use when deciphering)
    - When it runs with a second parameter that is not a valid alternate key (should return error)
