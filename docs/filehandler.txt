TopSecret documentation, filehandler
William Crouch 2/6/2026

For this assignment, I am member B- filehandler

My module will search the folder "data" when requested, it will find the target file and return its contents
It has one argument, the name of the file

Intended behavior:

    Called on "wiki"
        enters the data folder
        finds the wiki object and returns it
    Called on a name that does not exist in the database
        sysout("file not found")

    Test Cases:
    If run with no arguments, return no file input
