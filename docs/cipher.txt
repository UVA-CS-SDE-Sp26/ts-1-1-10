Homework 2
Adam Ismail (1-10)
For this homework, I am member D (cipher)

My job is to create tests for a function that replaces ciphered text as input and returns deciphered text using a map.
It should be able to use any key.

Week 3:

    Potential cipher logic (methods)
        CipherService - String decipher(String cipherText, Path keyPath)
            Loads + validates key + returns deciphered text)

        CipherKey - Map<Character, Character> decodeMap
            Represents the key in memory

        CipherKeyLoader - CipherKey load(Path keyPath) - throws IOException, InvalidCipherKeyException if incorrect
            Reads the key file and constructs a CipherKey

        CipherKeyValidator - void validate(String plain, String cipher) - throws InvalidCipherKeyException if incorrect
            Checks that the plain string and the cipher string match

        InvalidCipherKeyException - custom exception
            Clean error signaling

    Decide validation rules
        - File exists and can be read
        - Outputs exactly 2 non-empty lines
        - Both lines are the same length
        - No duplicate characters in either line

    Write test cases for:
        - deciphering text correctly
        - handling invalid keys
        - punctuation handling
        - empty input
        - key validation failures

    Document everything here in cipher
    Write a Week 1 (of groupwork) self-reflection

Week 4
    I have created the methods for each of the classes regarding cipher. It is meant to support deciphering of files
    using key-based substitution. The key is stored in cipher.txt. During execution, this file is loaded to ensure
    that the key still exists, and are equal in length. Then a map is constructed from cipher to plain characters to
    enable deciphering. The CipherService class performs the decipher operation, returning unmapped characters (such
    as punctuation or symbols) unchanged. An InvalidCipherKeyException is thrown if the key file cannot be read or fails
    validation. Unit tests were created to verify correct deciphering of lowercase and uppercase characters, mixed
    alphanumeric input, and handling of unmapped characters. All tests pass successfully and confirm that the cipher
    module functions according to the project requirements.
