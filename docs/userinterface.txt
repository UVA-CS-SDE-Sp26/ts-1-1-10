TopSecret documentation starter file - Homework 2
Gabriel Espinola (1-10)
For this homework, I am member A (command line interface)
This step allows for the user to easily run the command line interface
The program accepts parameters, then it ends when it does what is asked or prints error messages.

First week tasks:
    Command prompt basics logic

        Running the program in the terminal
            java topsecret
            Program exits

        Running with no arguments
            list the numbered files avaliable
            program exits

        Running with a number as an argument (file 01 for example)
            java topsecret 01
            displays the contents of the corresponding file of that argument
            program exits

        Running with two parameters (file 01 for example)
            java topsecret 01 alternateKey
            Specifies an alternate key to use when dechipering
            Displays the contents of the file using that alternate key
            program exits

    Errors
        print error if not file 01 02 or 03
        print error if more than 2 parameters

    Test cases
        If run with 0 arguments then lists the numbered files
        If run java topsecret 03 then prints the contents of file 3
