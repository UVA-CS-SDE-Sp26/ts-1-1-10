For this Homework, I am member C and am responsible for connecting the command line to the file handler
This program must interpret what is entered in the command line and then request that information from the file hander.
It then must return the information back to the command in a readable format


Test Cases:
If no files exist, program returns a message explain the error rather than crashing
Program returns list of files in proper format (e.g. 01 filea.txt)
Program handles input that doesn't match a file
Program correctly handles no parameter entry
